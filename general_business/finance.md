* what does [dupont analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuPont_analysis) really measure?
  * measures return on equity
    * assumes that the 3 important thingns are
      * profitability
        * measured by profit margin
      * asset efficiency
        * measured by asset turnover
      * financial leverage
        * measure by equity multiplier
  * calculated as `ROE = profit margin * asset turnover * equity multiplier`
    * broken down `ROE = (Net profit/Revenue) * (Revenue / Average Total Assets) * (Average Total Assets / Average Equity)`
  * can be used to benchmark companies in a single industry
  * benchmarks in different industries
    * high margin industries
      * industries such as fashion, derive a substantial portion of their competitive advantage from selling at a higher margin, rather than higher sales
        * For high-end fashion brands, increasing sales without sacrificing margin may be critical
    * high turnover industries
      * certain types of retail operations, particularly stores, may have very low profit margins on sales, and relatively moderate leverage
      * In contrast, though, groceries may have very high turnover, selling a significant multiple of their assets per year         * in thesee industries same store sales of may be considered more important as an indication that the firm is deriving greater profits from existing stores (rather than showing improved performance by continually opening stores).
    * high leverage industries
      * Some sectors, such as the financial sector, rely on high leverage to generate acceptable ROE
        * other industries would see high levels of leverage as unacceptably risky

* what does [asset turnover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_turnover) actually mean?
  * a financial ratio that measures the efficiency of a company's use of its assets in generating revenue
  * calculated as `asset turnover = net sales revenue / average total assets` 
    * where
      * sales 
        * comes from the company's income statement
      * average total assets
        * the average of the values of total assets from the company's balance sheet in the beginning and the end of the period 
        * calculated by adding up the assets at the beginning of the period and the assets at the end of the period then dividing the number by 2
  * part of dupont analysis

* what does [financial leverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)) actually mean?
  * basically the use of debt to spur more growth in purchasing more assets
  * the core idea is that in many sittuations the limiter to growth is money, in these cases not using debt is actually a dentriment since money is easy to find
    * of course taking debt increasing your risk of failure since it's a liability and paying the loan and interest will reduce your cash on hand to spend
    * thus there is a ratio of debt raised to finance the purchase of assets that is appropriate
    * every industry and every business is different, the financial leverage ratio demonstrates that business choice on leveraging assets
  * calculated as `total debt / shareholder equity`
  * where
    * total debt is the debt on the balance sheet
    * shareholder equity is the equity on the balance sheet
