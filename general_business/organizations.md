# what kind of [organizational forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure) are common ?
  * organizational structure is a structure that consists of activities such as coordination, supervsion, and task allocation
      * organizational structure determines how the organization performs or operates
      * specifically refers to how the people in an organizatin are grouped and to whom they report
  * Pre-bureaucratic structures
    * lack standardization of tasks
    * most common in smaller organizations and best used to solve simple tasks
    * completely centralized
      * leader makes all the key decisions and most communication is done by one on one conversation
      * allows leader to control growth and development
    * within the tripartite classification of authority model it is based on either
      * [traditional domination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_authority)
        * a form of leadership where authority of an organization is largely tied to tradition or custom
        * "it's always been that way" leadership
      * [charismatic domination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_authority)
        * a form of leadership where authority of an organization is largely derived from the charisma of the leader
  * Bureaucratic structures
    * tasks are standardized
    * most common in large scale organizations, usually as a tall structure
    * information
      * flows from top to bottom
    * decisions
      * tend to pass through many levels increasing organizational inertia
      * made through organized autocratic structures
      * authority is at the top
    * rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints
      * operational processes are created and closely supervised to ensure that the information from the top is communicated down without being tampered
    * advantage for top-level managers
      * tremendous control over organizational structure decisions
      * works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing
      * the concentration of the decision making at the top allows for faster strategic decision making
    * disadvantage for the org
      * discourages creativity and innovation in the organizatio
        * makes it hard for a company to adapt to contengencies
    * characteristics
      * clearly defined roles and responsabilities
        * organizational chart exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation
      * a hierarchical structure
      * respect for merit
  * Post-bureaucratic
    * variations of bureaucracy
    * hierarchies still exist
    * authority is still rational legal type
    * organization is still rule bound
  * Functional structure
    * an organizational structure where people are organized by function
    * operational efficiency is gained by employees becoming specialist within their own realm of expertise
    * typical problems
      * communication within the company becomes rigid, making the organization slow and inflexible
        * lateral communication between functions becomes very important 
      * communication can become very rigid becaus of the standardization of operation and high degreee of formalization
    * best suited for organizations producing standardized goods and services at large volume and low cost
    * coordination and specialization of tasks are centralized in a functional structure, which makes producing a limited number of products or services efficient and predictable
    * functional units perform with a high level of efficiency their level of cooperation with each other is sometimes compromised
      * groups may have difficulties working well with each other as they may be territorial
      * infighting among units may cause delays, reduced commitment due to competing interests, wasted time, leading to project delays
      * the overall of this can bring down production levels overall, and reduce company-wide employee commitment toward meeting organizational goals
  * Divisional structure
    * an organizational structure that consists of self-contained divisions
      * a division is a collection of functions which produe a product
      * also utilizes a plan to compete and operate as a separate business or profit center
      * employees who are responsible for certaiin market services or types of products are placed in divisional structure in order to increase their flexibility
      * example divisions
        * regional (u.s. division, eu division)
        * consumer type (b2b, b2c)
        * product type (trucks, SUVS, compacts)
      * divisions may have their own departments and redundency
    * advantage
      * authority is delegated allowing performance to be directly measured within each group
      * potentially more efficient in coordinating work between different divisions
      * potentially more flexibility in responding to the market
      * organizational change is simple as each division can be added or removed modularly since their are no external dependencies
    * disadvantage
      * can support unhealthy rivalries among divisions
      * increased cost by requiring more qualified managers for each division and duplicated resources
      * divisional goals may be emphasized over organizational goals resulting in duplication of resources and effort   
  * Matrix structure
    * groups employees by 2 dimensions often times function and something else
      * weak / functional marix
        * a project manager with only limited authority is assigned to oversee the cross-functional aspects of the project
        * a functional managers maintains control over their resources and project areas
        * functioinal manager has the upper hand
      * balanced / functional matrix
        * a project manager is assigned to oversee the project
        * power is shared equally between the project manager and functional manager
        * difficult to setup and mantain but brings the best of both system if at all functional
      * strong / project matrix
        * a project manager is primarily responsible for the project
        * functional manager provide technical expertise and assign resources as needed
    * advantages
      * improves upon the silo critique of functional management by aiming to diminish the vertical structure of functional and create more horizontal structure which allows the spread of information across task boundaries to happen much faster
      * allows specializatioin to increase depth of knowledge and allows individuals to be chosen according to project needs
    * disadvantages
      * tends to lead to anarchy, power struggles, and sinking to group and division levels
      * increases complexity of the chain of command
      * can be confusing for employees to understand who is next in the chain of command
      * higher manager to worker ratio that can result in conflicting loyalties of employees
  * Team
    * teams can be both horizontal and vertical
    * just groupings of people basically 
  * Network
    * contracting out business functions to networks of providers
    * managers spend most of their time coordinating and controlling external relations
  * Virtual
    * defined as being closely coupled upstream with its suppliers and downstream with its customers such that where one begins and the other ends means little too those who manage the business processes within the entire organizations
    * in essense a boundaryless organization
  * Hierarchy-community phenotype model
    * an organization has both a hierarchy and a community structure
      * both equally well established and occurring extensively throughout the organization
    * uses org chart to analyse formal authority 
    * uses social network analysis to map out the community structure within the organization

# what is the [tripartite classification of authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_classification_of_authority) model?
  * authored by Max Weber
  * three ideal types of legitimate political leadership, domination, and authority
    * charismatic authority (character, heroism, leadership, religious)
      * a form of leadership where authority of an organization is largely derived from the charisma of the leader
    * traditional authority (patriarchs, patrimonialism, feaudalism)
      * a form of leadership where authority of an organization is largely tied to tradition or custom
      * "it's always been that way" leadership
    * rational-legal authority (modern law and state, bureaucracy)
      * a form of leadership where authority is tied to legal rationality, legal legitimacy, and bureaucracy

# what is [organizational inertia](https://managingresearchlibrary.org/glossary/organizational-inertia)
  * the tendency of a mature organization to continue on its current trajectory, stems from
    * resource rigidity
      * an unwillingness to invest
      * relates to the motivation to respond
    * routine rigidity
      * an inability to change the patterns and logic that underlie those investment
      * the structure of the response

# what does [authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority) actually mean?
  * the right to exercise power and make decisions
   
# what are some [mechanisms of coordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mintzberg#Contribution_to_organization_theory)?
  * mutual adjustment
    * without formal, standardized mechanisms
    * achieves coordination by the simple process of informal communication 
      * as between two operating employees
  * direct supervision
    * when one person gives direct orders to others
    * achieves coordination by having one person issue orders or instructions to several others whose work interrelates 
      * as when a boss tells others what is to be done one step at a time
  * standardization of work processes
    * based on the documents that regulate work and are produced by technostructure
    * achieves coordination by specifying the work processes of people carrying out interrelated tasks
      * those standards usually being developed in the technostructure to be carried out in the operating coree as in the case of work instructions that come out of time-and-motion studies
  * standardization of outputs
    * only the results of work are regulated
    * achives coordination by specifying the results of different work
      * usually developed in the technostructure as in a financial plan that specfies subunit performance targets or specifications that outline the dimensions of a product to be produced
  * standardization of skills and knowledge
    * based on preparing the specialists outside the organization
    * achieves coordination by virtue of the related training the workers have received
      * as in medical specialists say a surgeon and anesthetist in an operating room responding almost automatically too each other's standardizd procedures
  * standardization of norms
    * based on organization's values, ideology
    * achieves coordination through shared norms such that everyone functions according to the same set of beliefs
      * as in a religious order
