# ReviewSheets
Hello reader,

This repo contains my own personal documentation. In many ways it is a conglomeration and reformating of a bunch of different sources. Some of these notes date as far back as 2011 (highschool) and some (notably this page) are as recent as today. 

Developing this resource is one of my main methods of learning, it is designed with me solely in mind. Invariably somethings are inaccurate, outdated, or just plain wrong. I am likely to correct these issues as I personally encouter the consequences they impose, but no sooner.

If you come across anything in these notes that you feel should not be on the internet please do let me know. If I agree with your reasoning I will happily take action.

Read at your own risk, learn responsibly.
