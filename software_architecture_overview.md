* what is [software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design)?
    * the process by which an agent creates a specification of a software artifact, intendedto accomplish goals, using a set of primitive components and subject to constraints
    * main components of software design
        * SRA (Software Requirements Analysis)
            * encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product or project by
                * taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders
                * analyzing system requirements
                * documenting system requirements
                * validating system requirements
                * managing system requirements
        * UX (User eXperience) design
            * the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving
                * usability
                * accessability 
                * pleasure provided in the interaction with the product 
            * may yield storyboards to help determine those specifications 
    * software analysis versus software design
        * analysis output
            * smaller problems to solve
        * analysis process
            * similar teams, organizations, and problems
        * design output
            * focuses on capabilities and thus multiple designs for the same problem will exist
        * design process
            * varies dependent on the environment 
    * software design as a process and a model
        * process
            * a sequence of steps that enable the designer to describe all aspects of the software for building 
        * model
            * begins by representing the totality of the thing that to be built 
            * slowly the thing is refined to provide guidance for constructing each detail
            * artifacts created provide different views of the software
    * set of principles
        * the design process should not suffer from tunnel vision
            * good designers consider alternative approaches judging each based on the requirements of the problem and the resources to do the job
        * the design should be traceable to the analysis model 
            * must be able to determine which requirements are met by which part of the model
        * the design should not reinvent the wheel
            * systems are constructed using a set of design patterns, many of which have been solved. use them. 
        * the design should minimize the intellectual distance between the software and the problem as it exists in the real world
            * the structure of the design should whenever possible mimic the structure of the problem domain
        * the design should exhibit uniformity and integration
            * design is uniform if it appears fully coherent 
            * design is integrated if care is taken in defining interfaces between design components
        * the design should be structured to accommodate change
        * the design should be structured to degrade gently 
            * things should not blow up
        * design is not coding, coding is not design
            * even when the detailed procedural designs are created for program components the level of abstraction of the design model is higher than source code
        * the design should be assessed for quality as it is being created not after the fact
            * a variety of design concepts and design measures are available to assist the designer in assessing quality throughout the development process
        * the design should be reviewed to minimize conceptual errors
            * substance over form
    * software design tools
        * UML (Unified Modeling Language)
            * general purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering, that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system
        * FMC (Fundamental Modeling Concepts)
            * provide a framework to describe software intensive systems using a semi-formal graphical notation
    * design concepts
