# June 2 - woooo new month - rails active record

we are now in june summer has broken through the clouds and blessed us with eternal warmth  

today we learn of the secrets of the ancient active record of the rails persuasian 

#### following [Active Record Basics](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)

* what is active record
	* active record puts the model in model - view - controller 
		* the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic 
	* implementation of the Active Record pattern
		* an interpretation of the Object Relational Mapping system spec 
	* the active record pattern 
		* objects carry both persistent data and behavior which operates on that data 
		* ensuring data access logic as part of the object will educate users of that object on how to write to and read from the database 
	* object relational mapping 
		* usually called ORM 
		* a technique that connects the rich objects of an application to tables in a relational database management system 
			* allows for the properties and relationships of objects in an application to be easily stored and retrieved from a database without writing SQL statements directly and with less overall databse access code 
	* active record as an ORM framework 
		* key mechanisms 
			* represent models and their data 
			* represent associations between these models 
			* represent inheritance hierarchies through related models 
			* validate models before they get persisted to the database 
			* perform database operations in an object-oriented fashion
	
* convention over configuration in active record 
	* follow rails conventions and you will need to do little to no configuration when creating active record models 
	* naming conventions 
		* active record uses some naming conventions to understand how the mapping between models and database tables should be created 
		* rails pluralizes your class names to find the appropriate database table 
			* for class `Book`
				* active record creates a database table called `books`
			* when using class names composed of two or more words 
				* the class name should follow the ruby conventions of CamelCase form 
					* the table name must contain words separated by underscores 
				* for class `BookClub`
					* active record creates a database table called `book_clubs`
			* pluralizes both regullar and irregular words 
	* schema conventions 
		* active record uses naming conventions for the columns in database tables depending on purpose of column 
			* foreign keys 
				* these fields are named following the pattern `singularized_table_name_id`
					* example: 	
						* `item_id` 
						* `order_id`
					* these are the fields that active record will look for when you create associations between your models 
			* primary keys 
				* by default active record uses an integer column named `id` as the tables primary key 
					* when using active record migrations to create your tables this column will be automatically created 	
			* optional column names 
				* `created_at`
					* automatically gets set to the current date and time when the record is first created
				* `updated_at`
					* automatically gets set to the current date and time whenever the record is updated 
				* `lock_version`
					* adds [optimistic locking](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Locking.html) to a model 
				* `type`
					* specifies that the model uses [single table inheritance](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#class-ActiveRecord::Base-label-Single+table+inheritance)
				* `(association_name)_type`
					* stores the type for [polymorphic associations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations)
				* `(table_name)_count`
					* used to cache the number of belonging objects on associations 
						* example: 
							* a `comments_count` column in a `Articles` class that has many instances of `Comment` will cache the number of existent comments for each article 
				* these keywords are all reserved by the system 
	
* creating active record models 
	* active record models are created by subclassing the `ActiveRecord::Base` class 
	```
		class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
		end
	```
		* creates a `Product` model mapped to a `products` table at the database 
		* you can also map the columns of each row in that table with the attributes of the instances of your model 
		* if the `products` table was created using SQL
		```
			CREATE TABLE products (
				id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment, 
				name varchar (255), 
				PRIMARY KEY   (id)
			);		
		```
			* you would be able to interact with the table in ruby 
			```
				p = Product.new
				p.name = "Some Book" 
				puts p.name # "Some Book"
			```
				* the code above would print `Some Book`

* overriding the naming conventions 
	* the default convetions are easily overridable 
		* in the declaration 
		```
			class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
				self.table_name = "my_products"
			end 
		```
			* you will have to manually define the class name that is hosting the fixtures (my_products.yml)
				* use the `set_fixture_class` method 
				```
					class ProductTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
						set_fixture_class my_products: Product
						fixtures :my_products 
						...
					end
				```
		* you can also override the column that should be used as the tables primary key 
		```
			class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
				self.primary_key = "product_id"
			end
		```
		
* CRUD: readign and writing data 
	* crud is an acronym for the four verbs we use to operate on data 
		* create
		* read 
		* update 
		* destroy
	* active record automatically creates methods to allow an application to read and manipulate data stored within its tables. 
	* create 
		* active record objects can be created from 
			* a hash 
			* a block 
			* have their attributes manually set after creation 
		* given model `User` with attributes `name` and `occupation`
			* the `create` method 
				* return the object and save it to the database 
				``` 
					user = User.create(name: "David", occupation: "Code Artist")
				```
					* the object will be created and saved into the db
			* the `new` method 
				* returns a new object 
				```
					user = User.new 
					user.name = "David" 
					user.occupation = "Code Artist"
				```
					* the object is instantiated but not save to the db 
					* the `save` method 
						* commits a record to the db

			* if a block is provided both `create` and `new` will yield the new object to that block for initialization 
			```
				user = User.new do |u|
					u.name = "David"
					u.occupation = "Code Artist" 
				end 
			```
	* read 
		* there is a rich api for accessing data within a  database 
			* the `all` method 
			```
				users = User.all
			```
				* return a collection with al users 	
		 	* the `first` method
			```
				user = User.first
			```
				* return the first user 
			* the `find_by` method
			```
				david = User.find_by(name: 'David')
			```
				* return the first user named David 
			* the `where` and `order` method 
			```
				users = User.where(name: 'David', occupation: 'Code Artist').order(created_at: :desc)
			```
			* more about reading with [active record](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html)
	
	* update 
		* once an active record object has been retrieved its attributes can be modified and it can be saved to the database
		```
			user = User.find_by(name: 'David')
			user.name = 'Dave'
			user.save
		```
		* you can use a hash map to be simpler
		```
			user = User.find_by(name: 'David')
			user.update(name: 'Dave')
		```
		* you can update a bunch at once with `update_all`
		```
			User.update_all "max_login_attempts = 3, must_change_password = 'true'"
		```
			* will apply to all users 
	
	* delete
		* once retrived an active record object can be destroyed removing it from the database 
		```
			user = User.find_by(name: 'David')
			user.destroy
		```

* valudations			 	
	* active record allows you to validate the state of a model before it gets written into the db 	
		* validation is a very important issue to consider when persisting to the database 
			* `save` and `update` take that into account when running 
				* they return `false` when validation fails without performing an operation on the database 
				* they have a bang counterpart 
					* stricter will raise an actual exception `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid`
		* several methods can be used to check models and validate that an attribute value
			* [validations are outlined here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)

* callbacks
	* active record callbacks allow you to attach code to certain events in the life-cycle of your models 
		* enables you to add behaviors to your models by transparently executing code when those events occur 
			* create new record 
			* update it 
			* destroy it 
	* [more on callbacks](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html) 

* migrations 
	* rails provide a domain-specific language for managing a database schema called migrations 
		* migrations are stored in files which are executed against any database that active record supports using `rake` 
		* example: 
		```
			class CreatePublications < ActiveRecord::Migration 
				def change 
					create_table :publications do |t|
						t.string :title
						t.text :description
						t.references :publication_type
						t.integer :publisher_id
						t.string :publisher_type
						t.boolean :single_issue 
				
						t.timestamps null:false
					end
					add_index :publications, :publication_type_id
				end 
			end
		```
	* rails keeps track of which files have been committed to the db and provides rollback features
	* to actually create the table you run `db:migrate` 
	* to roll it back you run `db:rollback`
	* more about [active record migrations](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html)

#### following [active record validation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)

* validation overview 
	* why use validations 	
		* used to ensure that only valid data is saved into your database 
		* model-level validations are the best way to ensure that only valid data is saved into your databases 
		* they are database agnostic, cannot be bypassed by end users, are convenient to test and maintain 
		* there are other ways to validate data before it is saved into your database 
			* native database constraints 
				* make the validation mechanisms database-dependent and can make testing and maintenance more difficult 
					* if database is used by other applications could be useful 
				* database-level validations can safely handle some things that can be difficult to implement otherwise 
			* client-side validations 
				* unreliable if used alone 
				* implemented using JavaScript 
				* can be used to provide immediate feedback as they use your site
			* controller-level validations 	
				* often become unwieldy and difficult to test and maintain 
				* keep the controllers skinny makes life easy

# June 5th - Exploring computer vision

		* [intelligent word recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_word_recognition)
			* also targets handwritten printscript or cursive text, one word at a time
			* especially useful for languages where glyphs are not separated in cursive script 
	* techniques 
		* pre-processing 
			* de-skew
				* if the document was not aligned properly when scanned it may need to be tilted a few degrees clockwise or counterclockwise in order to make lines of text perfectly horizontal or vertical 
				* [skew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_(fax))
					* the angular deviation of the received frame from the rectangularity cause by asynchronism between the scanner and the recorder 	
			* [despeckle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction)

			* line and word detection 
				* establishes baseline for word and character shapes, separates words if necessary 
			* script recognition 
				* in multilingual documents, the script may change at the level of the words and hence, identification of the script is necessary, before the right OCR can be invoked to handle the specific script 
			* character isolation (segmentation) 
				* for per-character OCR, multiple characters that are connected due to image artifacts must be separated; single characters that are broken into multiple pieces due to artifacts must be connected 
			* normalise aspect ratio and scale 
		* character recognition 
			* there are two basic types of core OCR algorithm 
				* matrix matching 
					* involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixel-by-pixel basis
					* also known as pattern matching 
					* also known as [image correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_correlation)
					* relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image, and on the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale 
					* works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered 
					* the technique implemented in early pphysical photocell-based OCR
				* feature extraction 
					* decomposes glyphs into features 
						* lines 
						* closed loops
						* line direction 
						* line intersections 
					* compared with an abstract vector like representation of a character 
						* might reduce to one or more glyph prototypes 
		* post-processing 
			* OCR accuracy can be increased if the ouput is constrained by a lexicon 
			* output stream may be a plain text stream or file of characters 
				* modern OCR systems can preserve the layout of the page and produce 
			* near-neighbor analysis 
				* can make use of co-occurence frequencies to correct errors by noting that certain words are often seen together

# June 10 - Rails resources 

#### resources in rails 
	* this is all out of date
		* [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4686945/what-is-a-resource-in-rails)
			* a resource is a database table which is represented by a model, and acted on through a controller 
				* the connection between the model and database is handled by action record 
				* there is a particular connection which maps uri access and CRUD operations handled by the controller to particular model operations and methods that in turn take action on the database 
					* this mapping is made by `map.resources :arbitary_resource_name`				
		* [routes driven development](http://www.stephenchu.com/2007/11/seeing-rails-resources-clearly.html)
			* a resource is not synonymous to a database table 
				* basically a resource is a route that mapps http verbs and controller actions 

	* `ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources`
		* this is the internal rails framework that handles the routing mapping 
		* resource routing allows you to declare all common routes with a single decleration 
			* `resources :photos`
		* resource routes that always have an ID associated with them, that are only ever retrieved one at a time use singular resources 	
			* `resource :profile`
		* resource can be nested 
			```
				resources :magazines do 
					resources :ads
				end
			```
		* resources can be grouped under namespaces
			* if so the appropriate controllers should be placed in the same parent directory 
			```
				namespace "admin" do 
					resources :posts, :comments
				end 
			```
		* be default the `:id` parameter does not accept dots 
			* this can be hacked 
			* `resources :articles, id: /[^\/]+/`
				* allows any character besides slashes to be part of your id 
		* in depth dive into the pieces 
			* constants 
				* this is a ruby concept 
					* a constant is like a variable, except that its value is supposed to remain constant for the duration of the program 
						* constants defined within a class or module may be accessed anywhere within the class or module 
						* outside class they can be accessed with the scope operator `::` prefixed by an expression that returns the appropriate class or module 
						* cannot be defined in methods 
			* modules/mixins
				* this is a ruby concept 
					* ruby modules are similar to classes in that they hold a collection of methods, constants, and other module and class definitions 
						* defined with the `module` keyword instead of `class`
					* ruby modules cannot create objects or be subclassed 
					* they specify that you want the functionality of a particular module to be added to the functionality of a class or of a specific object
					* module stand alone 
						* no module hierarchy of inheritance 
						* good place to collect constants 
				* they serve two purposes 
					* they can act as `namespace` 
						* define methods whose names will not clash with those defined elsewhere 
					* allow you to share functionality between classes 
						* if a class mixes in a module that module instance methods become available as if they had been defined in the class 
						* they get mixed in 
			* collections 
				* this is a ruby concept 
					* allow for organizing large amounts of data 
					* basically just a group of objects 
			* [ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing/Mapper/Resources.html#CANONICAL_ACTIONS)
				* Constants 
					* `VALID_ON_OPTIONS`
						* i think these dictates what a action is allowed to work on what type of resource 
							* CANONICAL_ACTIONS do not need prefixes or paths appendend  
						* values 
							* `[:new, :collection, :member]`
					* `RESOURCE_OPTIONS`
						* these are options that resources can have 
						* values 
							* `[:as, :controller, :path, :only, :except, :param, :concerns]`
								* `:path_names`
									* allows you to change the segment component of the `edit` and `new` actions 
										* `resources :posts, path_names: {new: "brand_new"}`
											* the above example will now change the default path of the resource segments from `posts/new` to `/posts/brand_new`
								* `:path`
									* allows you to change the path prefix for the resource 
										* `resources :posts, :path: 'posting'`
											* changes the default path of the resource from  `/posts` to `/postings`
								* `:only`
									* only generates routes for the given actions 
										```
											resources :cows, only: show
											resources :cows, only: [:show, :index]	
										```
											* will only generate the show and index route as oppose to the default of all them 
								* `:except`
									* generates all routes except for the given actions 
										```
											resources :cows, except: :show
											resources :cows, except: [:show, :index]
										```
											* will generate all routes except show and index
								* `:shallow`
									* generates shallow routes for nested resources 
										* when placed on a parent resource generates shallow routes for all nested resources
 										```
											resources : posts, shallow: true do 
												resources :comments 
											end
										```
											* this allows for URLs for resources that otherwise would be deeply nested to be shortened 
												* for example `/posts/a-long-permalink/comments/1234` becomes `/comments/1234`
								* `:shallow_path`
									* prefixes nested shallow routes with the specified path 
									```
										scope shallow_path: "sekret" do 
											resources :posts do	
												resources :comments, shallow: true
											end 	
										end 
									```
										* here the parent resource path get changed to the "sekret" namespace 
								* `:shallow_prefix`
									* prefixes nested shallow route names with specified prefix
									```
										scope shallow_prefix: "sekret" do 
											resources :posts do
												resources :comments, shallow: true
											end
										end
									```
										* adds a the prefix "sekret" to the name of the shallow route 
								* `:format`
									* allows you to specify the default value for optional `format` segment or disable it by supplying `false`
								
	
					* `CANONICAL_ACTIONS`
						* these are the basice resful actions 
						* values 
							* index, create, new, show, update, destroy 
				* public methods 
					* `collection()`
						* adds a route to the collection 
						* this lets rails recognize paths that are provided within the appropriately scoped controller 
						```
							resources :photos do 
								collection do 
									get 'search'	
								end 
							end
						```
							* the controller `PhotosController` can now recognize the uri path `/photos/search` using the GET http verb 
							* the route helpers `search_photos_url` and `search_photos_path` are also created 
					* `match( path, *rest)`
						* i have no idea what this does 
					* `member()`
						* adds a member route to the resource 
						* this lets rails recognize paths that are provided with the appropriately scoped controller and id 
						```
							resources :photos do
								member do 
									get 'preview' 
								end 
							end 
						```	
							* the controller `PhotosController` can now recognize the uri path `/photos/1/preview` using GET http verb
							* the route helprts `preview_photo_url` and `preview_photo_path` are also created 

# June 11 - rails form helpers 

learning all about how forms and rails sleep at night 

* [dealing with basic forms](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html)
	* `form_tag` 
		* the most basic form helper 
			```
				<%= form_tag do %>
					Form contents 
				<% end %>
			```
		* when called without an argument 
			* creats a `<form>` tag 
			* when submitted will POST to the current page 
			* for page `/home/index`
				```
					<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/" method="post">
						<input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&#x2713;"/>
						<input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden" value="J7CBxfHalt49OSHp27hblqK20c9PgwJ108nDHX/8Cts="/>
						Form contents
					</form>
				```
					* contains hidden input elements 
						* form cannot be succesfully submited without these 
						* forces browser to respect your forms character encoding 
							* in this case UTF-8
							* generated for all GET and POST forms 
						* cross-site request forgery protection
							* security feature 		
							* generated for all non-GET forms 
							* contains name authenticity_token 
	* generic search form 
		* contains 
			* form element with GET method 
			* a label for the input 
			* a text input element 	
			* a submit element 
		* use multiple form helpers to create this form 
			* `form_tag`
				* creates a form element 
			* `label_tag`
				* creates a label element 
			* `text_field_tag`
				* creates a text field input element 
			* `submit_tag`
				* creates a submit input element
			* example: 
				```
					<%= form_tag("/search", method: "get") do %>	
						<%= label_tag(:q, "search for:") %>
						<%= text_field_tag(:q) %>
						<%= submit_tag("search") %>
					<% end %>
				```
			* will generate the following HTML: 
				```
					<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/search" method="get">
						<input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&#x2713;" />
						<label for="q">search for:</label>
						<input id="q" name="q" type="text" />
						<input name="commit" type="submit" value="search" />
					</form>
				```
					* for every form input 
						* an id attribute is generated from its name
						* these ids can be useful for CSS styling or manipulation of form controls with JS
			* always use GET as the method for search forms 
				* it allows users to bookmark a specific search an get back to it 
		* multiple hashes in form helper calls 
			* `form_tag` helper accepts 2 arguments 
				* the path for the action 
					* does not have to be a string 
						* like `link_to` helper it can recognize a hash of url parameters
							* rails recognizes them in the routing mechanism 
							* turns them into a valid url 
				* an options hash 
					* specifies the method of the form submission and html options such as the form elements classes 
			* since both options can be hashes be careful deliniating between the two 
				* can be donw by wraping first hash in curly brakcets or both hashes 
				* example: 
					```
						form_tag({controller: "people", action: "search"}, method: "get", class: "nifty_form")
					```
		* helpers for generating form elements 
			* rails has a lot of helpers for generating form elements 
				* the first parameter of these is always the name of the input 
					* when the form is submitted the name is passed along with the form data 
					* it will make its way to the `params` hash in the controller with the value entered by the user for that field 
						* example: 
							* `<%= text_field_tag(:query) %>`
								* the value of this field is passed to the controller with `params[:query]`
			* when naming inputs rails uses certain conventions that make it possible to submit parametes with non-scalar vaules such as arrays or hashes 
				* these will also be accessible in `params` 
			* checkboxes 
				* a form control that gives the user a set of options they enable or disable 
				* example: 
					```
						<%= check_box_tag(:pet_dog) %> 
						<%= label_tag(:pet_dog, "I own a dog") %>
						<%= check_box_tag(:pet_cat) %> 
						<%= label_tag(:pet_cat, "I own a cat") %>
					```
				 * html: 
					```
						<input id="pet_dog" name="pet_dog" type="checkbox" value="1" />
						<input for="pet_dog">I own a dog</label>
						<input id="pet_cat" name="pet_cat" type="checkbox" value="1" />
						<input for="pet_cat">I own a cat</label>
					```
				* parameters to `check_box_tag`
					* name of the input 
					* the value of the input 
						* included in the form data 
							* will be present in the controller in the `params` when the box is checked 
			* radio buttons 
				* similar to checkboxes
				* form controls that specify a set of options in which they are mutually exclusive 
					* user can only pick one
				* example: 
					```
						<%= radio_button_tag(:age, 'child') %>
						<%= label_tag(:age_child, "I am younger than 21") %>
						<%= radio_button_tag(:age, 'adult') %>
						<%= label_tag(:age_adult, "I am over 21" %>
					```
				* html: 
					```
						<input id="age_child" name="age" type="radio" value="child" />	
						<label for="age_child">I am younger than 21</label>
						<input id="age_adult" name="age" type="radio" value="adult" />
						<label for="age_adult">I am over 21</label>
					```
				* parameters to `radio_button_tag` 
					* the inputs share the same name making them mutually exclusive 
					* the value of the input 
						* included in the form data 
							* controller will be able to retrieve in `params` however only on of the inputs can pass a value since they have the same name 
			* other helpers of interest 
				* form controls 
					* `text_area_tag`
					* `password_field_tag`
					* `hidden_field_tag`
						* are not shown to the user but hold data 
					* `search_field`	
						* html 5 control
					* `telephone_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `date_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `datetime_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `datetime_local_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `month_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `week_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `url_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `email_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `color_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `time_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `number_field`
						* html 5 control
					* `range_field`
						* html 5 control
				* example: 
					```
						<%= text_area_tag(:message, "hi, nice site", size: "24x6") %>
						<%= password_field_tag(:password) %>
						<%= hidden_field_tag(:parent_id, "5") %>
						<%= search_field(:user, :name) %>
						<%= telephone_field(:user, :phone) %>
						<%= date_field(:user, :born_on) %>	
						<%= datetime_field(:user, :meeting_time) %>
						<%= datetime_local_field(:user, :graduation_day) %>
						<%= month_field(:user, :birthday_month) %>
						<%= week_field(:user, :birthday_week) %>
						<%= url_field(:user, :homepage) %>
						<%= email_field(:user, :address) %> 
						<%= color_field(:user, :favorite_color) %> 
						<%= time_field(:task, :started_at) %>
						<%= number_field(:product, :price, in: 1.0..20.0, step: 0.5) %>
						<%= range_field(:product, :discount, in: 1..100) %> 
					```
				* html: 
					```
						<textarea id="message" name="message" cols="24" rows="6">Hi, nice site</textarea>
						<input id="password" name="password" type="password" />
						<input id="parent_id" name="parent_id" type="hidden" value="5" />

* dealing with model objects 
	* model object helpers 
		* you can use tags without the `tag` suffix 
		* objects need to be mentioned 
		* these helpers take two arguments 
			* name of an instance variable 
			* name of a method to call on that object 
		* rails will set the value of the input control to the return value of that method for the object and set an appropriate input name 
		* example: 
			* controller has `@person` as a instance variable 
				* `@person` has an attribute `:name`
					* `:name` has a value of "Henry"
			* `<%= text_field(:person, :name) %>`
			* produces html output 
				* `<input id="person_name" name="person[name]" type="text" value="Henry" />`
					* when submitted the value entered by the user will be stored in `params[:person][:name]`
						* this value can then be used to be passed to methods of the `@person` instance variable 
	* binding a form to an object 
		* `form_for`
			* binds a form to a model object 
			
			* example: 
				* `app/controllers/articles_controller.rb`
					```
						def new 
							@article = Article.new
						end		
					```
				* `app/views/articles/new.html.erb`
					```
						<%= form_for @article, url: {action: "create"}, html: {class:"nifty_form"} do |f| %>
							<%= f.text_field :title %>
							<%= f.text_area :body, size: "60x12" %>
							<%= f.submit "Create" %>
						<% end %>
					```
				* things to note
					* `@article` is being edited 
					* there is a single hash of options 
						* routing options are passed in the `:url` hash
						* html options are passed in the `:html` hash 
						* namespace can be passed in a `:namespace` option 
							* attribute will be prefixed with underscore ont he generated html id
						* `form_for` yields a form builder object 
							* this is what the `f` variable is 
							* methods to create form controls are called on the form builder object f 
				* html output:
					```
						<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/articles/create" method="post" class="nifty_form">
							<input id="article_title" name="article[title]" type="text" />
							<textarea id="article_body" name="article[body]" cols="60" rows="12"></textarea>
							<input name="commit" type='submit' value="Create" />
						</form>
					```
						* the name passed to `form_for` controls the key used in the `params` to access the forms values 
		* `fields_for` 
			* creates a similar binding to `form_for` but does not create a <form> html object 
				* simply makes the attributes of a model object available 
			* `form_for` calls `fields_for` internally 
		* relying on record identification 			
			* RESTful resources and `form_for` play nicely together if you rely on record identification 
				* rails basically does all the work for you 
			* example: 
				* `app/views/articles/new.html.erb`
					```
						## creating a new article 
						# long-style: 
						form_for(@article, url: articles_path)
						# same thing, short-style (record identification gets used): 
						form_for(@article)
					
						## editing an existing article
						# long-style 	
						form_for(@article, url: article_path(@article), html: {method: "patch"})
						# short-style
						form_for(@article)
					```
						* the short form is smart enough to now if it is editing a record or creating a new one
							* will automatically select the correct path to submit to and name based on class of the object 
			* STI(single-table inheritance) is not compatible with record identification 
		* dealing with namespaces 
			* if the routes are namespaced `form_for` has a shorthand 
				* example: 
					* `form_for [:admin, @article]`
						* creates a form that submits to the `ArticlesController` inside the admin namespace 
						* works with namespace nesting
		* how do forms with PATCH, PUT, or, DELETE methods work 	
			* most browsers do not support methods other than GET and POST when submiting forms 
				* rails emulates other methods over POST with a hidden input named `"_method"`	
					* `form_tag(search_path, method: "patch")`
				* html output
					```
						<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/search" method="post">	
							<input name="_method" type="hidden" value="patch" />
							<input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&#x2713;" />
							<input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden" value="long fucking hash xx"/>
						</form>
					```
				* rails will be chill and use the method in the hidden field 

* making a select boxes with ease
	* the select and option tags 
		* `select_tag`
			* helper which generates a select html tag containing an option string 
				* `<%= select_tag(:city_id, '<option value="1">Lisbon</option>...')%>`
					* does not dynamically create the option tags 
		* `options_for_select` 
			* helper which dynamically generates option html tags 
				```
					<%= options_for_select([['Lisbon', 1], ['Madrid', 2], ...], 2) %>
				```
				* html output: 
				```
					<option value="1">Lisbon</option> 
					<option value="2" selected="selected">Madrid</option> 
				```
			* the first argument is a nested array	
				* each element has two elements 	
					* option text	
						* this case city name 
					* option value 	
						* this case city id 
						* this is submitted to the controller 
			* allows you to preselect an option by passing the value of the option as the second argument to the helper 
			* arbitrary attributes can be added to the options using hashes
				* `<%= options_for_select([['Lisbon', 1, {'data-size' => '2.8 million'}]], 1) %>`
				* html output: 
					* `<option value="1" data-size="2.8 million">Lisbon</option>`

		* can be combined to do smart things 
			* `<%= select_tag(:city_id, options_for_select(...))%>`
				* will do all of the previous things 
	* select boxes for dealing with models 
		* rails has helpers built just for dealing with the fuckery of select and options with models
		* controller: 
			* `@person = Person.new(city_id: 2)`
		* view: 
			* `<%= select(:person, :city_id, [['Lisbon', 1], ['Madrid', 2], ...]) %>`
		* comentary from the rails gods 
			* the first parameter 
				* an instance variable corresponding with a model graced by the controller 
			* the second parameter 
				* the helper checks the instance variable matching property to see if there already is a match in values 
				* in this case the option 'Madrid' would be preselected since the :city_id match 
			* the third parameter	
				* an options array just like the `options_for_select`
			* if using a form builder scoper to the instance variable 
				* `<%= f.select(:city_id, ...) %>`	
					* magic 
		* red flag: 
			* beware of using `select`, `collection_select`, `select_tag` to set a `belongs_to` association 
				* must pass the name of the foreign key not the name of the association itself 
				* this is a security threat?
	* options tags from a collection of arbitrary objects 
		* the `options_for_select` helper requires you to create an array containing the text and value for each option 
		* you can also generate the select and options tags from a collection of objects 
			* take for example a `City` model
				* you could iterate over a nested array 
					* view: 		
						```
							<% cities_array = City.all.map { |city| [city.name], city.id] } %>
							<%= options_for_select(cities_array) %>
						```
				* rails has a helper for that 
					* `options_from_collection_for_select`
						* expects 
							* a collection of arbitraty objects 
							* the name of the methods to read the option value 
							* the name of the methods to read the text value 
						* example 
							* `<%= options_from_collection_for_select(City.all, :id, :name) %>` 
								* generates the option tags from 
									* all the City instances 
									* their :id
									* their :name
					* `<%= collection_select(:person, :city_id, City.all, :id, :name) %>`
						* you can probably figure out how this works 
	* time zone and country select 
		* rails has a helper specifically for timezone selects 
			* example 
				* `<%= time_zone_select(:person, :time_zone) %>`
		* can be done more intricatly using 
			* `time_zone_options_for_select` 

* using date and time form helpers 
	* there are alternative date and time helpers available		
		* these are different 
			* data and times are not representable by a single input element 
				* input for each component (year, month, day, etc.)
				* no single value in `params` hash in controller
			* other helpers use the `_tag` suffix to indicate whether a helper is a barebones helper or a model helper 
				* `select_date`, `select_time`, `select_datetime`
					* barebones helpers 
				* `date_select`, `time_select`, `datetime_select`
					* model helpers 
	* barebones helpers 
		* the `select_*` family of helpers 
			* first argument 
				* instance of `Date`, `Time`, or `DateTime` 
					* `<%= select_date Date.today, prefix: :start_date %>`
					* used as the currently selected value 
			 		* if omitted the current date is used 
					* `params[:start_date]` in the controller
						* a hash with keys 
							* `:year`, `:month`, `:day`
						* to get an actual `Date`, `Time`, or `DateTime` object you must extract these values and pass them to the appropriate constructor 
							* `Date.civil(params[:start_date][:year].to_i, params[:start_date][:month].to_i, params[:start_date][:day].to_i)`
						* the `:prefix` option is the key used to retrieve the hash of date components from the `params` hash
	* model object helpers 
		* `select_date` does not work well with forms that create Active Record objects 
			* Active Record expects each elements in the `params` hash to correspond to one attribute 
		* the model object helper submits parameters with key word names 
			* Active Record knows how to react 
			* it knows how to appropriately combine columns 
		* example: 
			* `<%= date_select :person, :birth_date %>`
			
		* html output: 
			```
				<select id="person_birth_date_1i" name="person[birth_date(1i)">
				<select id="person_birth_date_2i" name="person[birth_date(2i)">
				<select id="person_birth_date_3i" name="person[birth_date(3i)">
			```		
		* controller receives on submition: 
			```
				{ 'person': 	
					{ 'birth_date(1i)': '2008',
					  'birth_date(2i)': '11',
					  'birth_date(3i)': '22'}
				}
			```
			* when this hash is passed to `Person.new` 	
				* Active Record spots that these parameters should be used to construct the birth_date attribute and uses the suffixes information to determine which order it should pass these parameters to other functions 
	* common options 
		* both barebones and model object helpers accept largely the same options 
		* default: 
			* rails generate year options 5 years on either side of the current year 
				* the `:start_year` and `:end_year` options override this behavior 
		* [exhaustive list of options](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html)
		* individual components 
			* some times you need to display just a single date component such as a year or a month 
				* each component has its own helper 
					* `select_year`, `select_month`, `select_day`, `select_hour`, `select_minute`, `select_second`
			
* uploading files 
	* to upload files the forms encoding must be set to 'multipart/form-data' 
		* done automatically with `form_for` must be done manually for `form_tag`
	* rails has usual helper dichotamy 
		* barebones `file_field_tag`
			* in the controller access with `params[:picture]`
		* model helper `file_field`
			* in the controller access with `params[:person][:picture]`
	* what gets uploaded 
		* controller `params` hash 
			* an instance of a subclass of `IO` object 
				* may be a `StringIO` object 
				* may be a `File` object 
					* backed by a temporary file 
				* both cases object will have an
					* `original_filename` attribute 	
						* the name the file had on the users computer 
					* `content_type` attribute 
						* contains the MIME type of the uploaded file 
				* example: 
					```
						def upload 
							uploaded_io = params[:person][:picture]
							File.open(Rails.root.join('public', 'uploads', uploaded_io.original_filename), 'wb') do |file|		
								file.write(uploaded_io.read)
							end
						end
					```
						* basically the controller reads the received file into a local copy
		* dealing with Ajax 
			* asynchronous file upload form is not as simple as a plug and play helper 
			* its fucked?

* customizing form builders 
	* objects yielded by `form_for` and `fields_for` are instances of `FormBuilder`
		* `FormBuilder` can be subclassed and extended 
		
* understanding parameter naming conventions 
	* values from forms can be at the top level of `params` or nested in another hash 
		* a create action for a Person model 
			* `params[:person]` would contain all the attributes for the person to create 
		* the `params` hash can also contain arrays, arrays of hashes, and so on
	* basic structures 
		* arrays 
			* duplicate parameter names will be accumullated in an array 
		* hashes 
			* mirror syntax used for accessing the value in `params` 
	* combining them 
		* only one level of arrayness is permited 
			* array does not play well with `check_box` helper 
	* using form helpers 
		* you can do some interesting play between `form_for`, `fields_for` and `:index` 
		* example: 
			```
				<%= form_for @person do |person_form| %> 
					<%= person_form.text_field :name %> 
					<% @person.addresses.each do |address| %> 
						<%= person_form.fields_for address, index: address.id do |address_form| %>
							<%= address_form.text_field :city %>
						<%end%>
					<%end%>
				<%end%>

i still have no idea what im doing. but im starting to get a handle on what questions to ask. 

#### questions 
	
* what the fuck is a `belongs_to` association?

# 6/22 fuck forms 

forms are very annoying 

* label and check box 
	* [stack overflow deffff](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18432376/what-does-for-attribute-do-in-html-label-tag)
	* label tags can be used to click on associated input elements 
		* two methods 
			* nest the checkbox into the label tag 
			* use the `for` attribute 
				* will associate the label to the checkbox that contains the same name 	

# 6/23 css dreams 

css you are so silly but ily

* make a circular border thing
	* the css border radius property 
		* dictates the roundedness of each components of an element 
			* accepts 
				* length in pixels
				* length in percentage 
				* initial (default)
				* inherits from parent element 
		* basically turn border-radius to 50% to make a circle 
	
* [the difference between masking and clipping](https://css-tricks.com/clipping-masking-css/)
	* this shit is totally not supported
		* ie dead, firefox poor 
	* fundemental difference 
		* masks are images 
			* simple image 
		* clips are paths 
			* inside path opaque outside path transparent 
	
	* clip 
		* `clip: rect(10px, 20px, 40px, 30px);`
			* similar to margin 
		* restrictions 	
			* only works if element is `position: absolute` 
			* can only do rectangles 
	* clip-path 
		* `clip-path: inset(10px 20px 30px 40px);`
			* single value: all sides the same 
			* 2 values: vert/horz
			* 3 values: top/horz/bottom
		* clip a circle 
			* `clip-path: circle(60px at center);`
		* clip an ellipse 
			* `clip-path: ellipse(60px 40px at 75px 30px);`
		* clip a polygon 
			* `clip-path: polygon(5% 5%, 100% 0%, 100% 75%, 75% 75%, 75% 100%, 50% 75%, 0% 75%);`
			* [indepth of clip-path polygons](https://css-tricks.com/sketchy-avatars-css-clip-path/)
	* masking 
		* there was a webkit-only version of masking 
		* you can link up an svg file as a mask 
			
* the html `data` attribute
	* a great solution for custom element-associated metadata
	* [the data-* attribute](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp)
		* used to store custom data private to the page or application 
		* gives the ability to embed custom data attributes on all html elements 
		* the stored data can be used by JS to create a more engaging user experience without making any Ajax calls or server-side db queries 
		* consist of two parts 
			* the attribute name 
				* should not contain any uppercase letters 
				* must contain the prefix `data-`
				* must be at least on character long following the prefix
			* the attribute value 
				* can be any string 
	* [using data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes)
		* basically the data-* attribute is an idiomatic way to store information in semantic html elements without hacks 
		* useful for storing information that does not have any visual reprsentation 
		* javascript access 
			* the key-value pairs can be read from elements using 
				* `getAttribute()` function 
				* using standard `.` notation on the element itself through the `dataset` property
					* `-` are converted to camelcase 
					* `article.dataset.columns`
		* css access 
			* the key-value pairs can be read from elemnts using 	
				* `attr()` function 
				* this can be very useful in combination with css generated content and the content css property 
				* can use [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) in css to change styles according to the data 
	* browser support 
		* IE 11+ supports 

# June 25 - browser and file uploads 

basically diving deep into file uploads and stuff and how they are implemented 

#### questions 

* will dropzone handle the upload process even if the upload interface is the default browser upload interface?

* when i select a file to upload from the OS, or i drag and drop a file into the browser, what generates the POST request and where/how does it get stored (browser memory, browser cache...)?

* if we have both interfaces displayed at all times, can the state of one interface affect the state of the other?

	* i drag and drop, i see a preview; i then select-for-upload, the preview disappears or even better, changes to the image i just selected-for-upload?

	* i select-for-upload, i see a file name; i then drag and drop, the file name disappears or even better, changes to the file name of the new image?

* what really is MIME type?
	* stands for Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions 
	* a standard way of classifying file types 
		* two parts seperated by a slash 
			* top-level type name 
				* registered names 
					* application 
					* audio 
					* example 
					* image 
					* message 
					* model 
					* multipart 
					* text
					* video 
			* subtype 
	* example: 
		* `application/json`

* what is an ENCTYPE?
	* a form attribute that specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitted to the server 
	* can only be used if metho="post"

* what is a positioning context?

* what is this flow concept in css? fucking annoying that i dont understand it 

* why is em value better for accessibility?

* what are linear gradients? 

* what is a polyfil ?

* what is a [blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob)?
	* a file-like object of immutable, raw data
	* represents data that is not necessarily JS natove format 
	* the [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) object is based off of it

* what is a [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader);
	* a object that lets web apps asynchronously read the contents of files (or raw data buffers) stored on the users computer 


#### research 

* [form-based file upload in html: rfc 1867](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt)
	* circa 1995 yall
	* abstract: 
		* extend html to 
			* express file upload request uniformly 
			* MIME compatible representation for file upload responses 
	* html forms with file submission 
		* current html
			* input: checkbox, hidden, image, password, radio, reset, submit, text 
		* ENCTYPE attribute using post method have default value 
			* "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
		* changes 
			* add a file option for input tags 
			* allow an accept attribute for input tags 
				* list of media types or type patterns allowed for the input 
			* defines new MIME media type 
				* multipart/form-data
			* specifies behavior of html user agents when interpretung a form with 
				* ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" 
				* <input type="file">
	* suggested implementation 
		* display of file widget 
			* browse button with a file selection gui 
			* accept attribute constrains the file extensions allowed 
		* action on submit 
			* send the form data and content of the selected files 
				* encoding type `multipart/form-data` is used since the other is insufficient 
		* use of multipart/form-data 
			* each field is sent in order in which it appears in the form as part of the stream 
				* identifies the input name within the form 
				* labelled with an appropriate content-type if media type is known 
			* if multiple files are selected they should be transferred together using the `multipart/mixed format`	
			* http protocol can transport arbitrary binary data 
				* the default for mail transport is 7Bit encoding 
				* may need to supply the `content-transfer-encoding` header if the value does not conform to default encoding 
			* the original local file name may be supplied as well 
				* filename parameter within 
					* `content-disposition: form-data` header (single file) 
					* `content-disposition: file` header of the subpart (multiple files)
			* the server realizes that it is `multipart/form-data` and does special shit to it 
		* interpretation of other attributes 
			* value attribute 
				* could be used with `<input type=file>` tags for a default file name 
			* size attribute 
				* width 
					* default for filename width 
				* height 
					* expected size showing the list of selected files for filename area 
	* backward compatibility issues 
		* i just dont care sorry 
	* other considerations 
		* compression, encryption 
			* rfc thinks these topics are out of scope 
		* deferred file transmission 
			* lost patience 



* [some clarity on file upload](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12085392/how-html-file-upload-works)
	* web applications are sandboxed and cannot access local files directly 
		* file upload picker must somehow reach an OS api to select a file in the local computer 
			* once a user has selected a file the web application can access it 

* [how does the browser determine the mime type to send](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1201945/how-is-mime-type-of-an-uploaded-file-determined-by-browser)
	* mime type sent by the browser is likely to be the one reported by the OS

	* [sending form data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data)
		* web is based on basic client/server architecture
		* the client side: defining how to send the data 
			* the `<form>` element itslef defines how the data will be sent 
				* attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button 
					* action 
						* defines where the data gets sent 
						* value must be a valid url 
						* if not provided data will be sent to the url of the page containing the form 
					* method  
						* defines how the data is sent 
						* form data can be sent via 
							* get method 
								* retrieves from server something 
								* never send sensitive data via get
							* post method 
								* form data is part of the body of the http request 
								* the `content-length` header 			
									* indicates the size of the body 
								* the `content-type` header 
									* indicates the type of resource sent to the server 
								* large amount of data the post method is preferred 
		* special case: sending files 
			* files are binary data 
			* the enctype attribute 
				* specifies the value of `content-type` 
					* must be set to `multipart/form-data` so that the data is split into multiple parts
						* one for each file 
						* one for the text of the form body that may be sent with it
		* security concerns 
			* concentrated on the server side 
			* XSS and CSRF 
				* Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
					* allows the attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users 
					* can be used to bypass access controls like 
						* [same origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)
					* exploits the trust a user has for a website 
				* Cross-Site Request Forgery   
					* allows the user to inject client-side script into web pages 
						* target ti attempt to escalate privileges of user to that of a higher-privileged user to perform actions it should not be able to do 
					* exploits the trust a web site has for its users
				* sanitize user input always 
			* sql injection 
				* attempts to perform actions on a database used by the website 
				* typically involve sending an sql request in the hope that the server will execute it 
				* can cause data loss to unprivileged access 
			* http header injection and email injection 
				* leave you open to session hijcking and phishing attacks 
			* be paranoid 
				* all data should be sanitized 
				* escape potentially dangerous characters 		
				* limit the incoming amount of data allowed only to whats necessary 
				* sandbox upploaded files 
	* [data form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Data_form_validation)
		* the browser can validate user data without relying on scripts 
			* [validation attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation)
		* when an element is  invalid 
			* the element will match the `:invalid` css pseudo-class enabling particular styles (same goes for `:valid`)
			* if the user tries to send the data the browser will block the form and display an error message
		* validation constraints on `<input>` elements 
			* can be validated using the [pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-pattern) attribute 
				* expects a case sensitive regular expression as its value 
					* if not empty and does not match it will be considered invalid 
			* the [required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-required) attribute 
				* the form cannot be submitted if this input field is empty 
		* other validation constraints 
			* textarea does not support the pattern attribute 
			* all input and textarea elements can be constrained with [maxlength](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-maxlength)
			* number fields have a [min](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-min) and [max](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-max) that make anything below the min and above the max invalid 
		* customized error messages 
			* these front end validation error messages are standard browser behavior left to the whim of the browser local 
				* to customize the text and appearance of these messages you must use JS 
			* html5 has a [constraint validation api](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-constraint-validation-api)
				* allows you to check and customize the state of a form element 
				* allows you to change the text of the error message

				* three states 
					* the normal state 
						* the page loads 
						* the widget was active and the user clicks anywhere outside the widget 	
						* the widget was active and the user moves the focus to another widget using the keyboard 
					* the active state 
						* the user clicks on it 
						* the user hits the tab key and it gains focus 
						* the widget was in its open state and the user clicks on the widget 			
					* the open state 
						* the widget is in any other state than open and the user clicks on it 					
				* behavior 
					* widget must be usable with a mouse, and a keyboard 
					* the value of the widget changes 
						* the user clicks on an option when the widget is in the open state 
						* the user hits the up or down arrow keys when the widget is in its active state 
					* the options of the widget 
						* when the widget is opened the selection option is highlighted 
						* when the mouse is over an option, the option is highlighted and the previously highlighted option is returned to its normal state

		* gaining control over the global interface 
			* remain in control of the user interface 
		* how is [ajax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX) different		
			* ajax techniques rely mostly on [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) (XHR) DOM objects
				* allows you to build http request, send them, and retrieve the results of those requests 
				* works with both xml and json 
					* neither fit the structure of form data requests 
						* form data request are url-encoded lists of key/value pairs 
						* for binary data the whole http request is changed to deal with it 
		* sending form data 
			* three ways to send form data 
				* [building a DOM in a hidden iframe (legacy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Sending_forms_through_JavaScript#Building_a_DOM_in_a_hidden_iframe)

						* retrieve the content of the hidden `<iframe>` to access the result of what you sent 
					* this is a bad idea and you will get hacked 
				* [building an XMLHttpRequest manually](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Sending_forms_through_JavaScript#Building_an_XMLHttpRequest_manually)
					* to do this you must encode the data properly all data must be url-encoded

		* part of the [UI event specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/)

			* basically the life cycle of an event 
		* [three phases](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/an-introduction-to-dom-events)
			* capture phase 
				* the event starts at the window object and propagates its way down to the target elements parent 
				* event listeners bound to this phase handle the event before it reaches the target
				* fires on each node as it propagates down 
					* builds the propagation path and sets the path that the bubbling phase will take back 
			* target phase 	
				* the event reaches the target element 
				* event listeners bound to this phase handle the event once it has reached its target 
				* if the event is set to not bubble the event stops once this phase is over
				* events always target the most deeply nested elements
			* bubbling phase 
				* the event propagates through the targets ancestors in reverse order until it reaches the window 
				* event listeners bound to this phase handle the event before it reaches the window 
				* the event is fired on every node on its way back to the window from the target 
				* this behavior allows us to listen for events and catch them as they are bubbling back up 
					* prevents setting a million event handlers everywhere, since the event will pass by all the nodes on the propagation path
