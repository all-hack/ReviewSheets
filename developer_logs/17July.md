	* cpp piscine
		* continue to build cpp code generator :)
			* twizform

wooo. my cpp code generator is coming together nicely. makes me happy that i'm finally getting into meta programmig. 42 has been amazing for my technical capabilities it's kinda nuts. also good to know that i learn bottom up best. technical things are so much more natural now, and i can even alternate between the two with much more ease. combinatorial abilities are also significantly elevated. it's been a good year.

to proceed with the twizform project i need to have a good way to store classes and the relationship between their parts. i think taking a JSON like form is definitely the way to go. i can just have a loose implicit standard and have all my tools assume it. then i can build a hpp analyser that will just munch the class (or classes) into this abstract form. from there it's simple enough to generate the matching cpp. this project makes me happy.

i need to make a set list of tasks to do tomorrow.

* list of shit
	* pay health insurance
		* call them back
	* try to get a coffe meeting with one of the SWE at YC
		* prepare data, send email
	* wednesday
