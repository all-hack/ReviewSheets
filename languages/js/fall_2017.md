# notes on "modern" javascript around the time of fall 2017

* how do [variables work in js](https://learn.tylermcginnis.com/courses/51206/lectures/3167412)?
	* variable declarations introduce new identifiers
	* variables are initialized with value undefined when initially declared
	* initialization is when you intially asign a value to a variable 
	* scope defines where variables and functions are accessible within your code
		* global scope
			* accessible everywhere
			* variables declared without the `var` keyword are in global scope
		* function scope
			* variables declared in functions remain within that scope
			* passed down to nested functions
		* there is no block scope
			* for loops are not scoped
			* this shit is weird
	* hoisting
		* when the js interpreter evaluates your code moves all function and variable declarations to the top of your code
	* variable keywords
		* var
			* function scoped
			* referencing a variable before the value is declared will give you value undefined
		* let
			* block scoped
			* available within the block its created by it and all those below it
			* hoisted to top of block
			* referencing a let variable before it is declared will cause a reference error
		* const
			* same thing as let 
			* basically a C const
			* once initialized value cannot be changed
			* if const is an object
				* properties are still mutable
			* not immutable
		* be smart use let and const

* what is [object and array destructuring](https://learn.tylermcginnis.com/courses/51206/lectures/3167415)?
	* a convenient way to extract values from data stored in objects and arrays
	* example
	```
		function register(props) {
			var onChangeEmail = props.onChangeEmail;
			var email = props.email;
			var onChangePassword = props.onChangePassword;
			var password = props.password;
			var submit = props.submit;
			return (
				<div>
					<span>Email:</span>
					<input type='text' onChange={onChangeEmail} value = {email} />
					<span>Password:</span>
					<input type='text' onChange={onChangePassword} value={password} />
					<button onClick={submit}>Submit</button>
				</div>
			)
		}
	```
	* turns into 	
	```
		function register (props) {
			var {onChangeEmail, email, onChangePassword, password, submit} = props;
			return (
				<div>
					<span>Email:</span>
					<input type='text' onChange={onChangeEmail} value = {email} />
					<span>Password:</span>
					<input type='text' onChange={onChangePassword} value={password} />
					<button onClick={submit}>Submit</button>
				</div>
			)
		}
	```
	* can be done within the function declaration

* what are [shorthand method names in ES6](https://learn.tylermcginnis.com/courses/51206/lectures/3167436)?
	* shorthand method names allow you to drop the ":function" component of a method
	* example
	```
		const actions = {
			sayName: function () {
				alert(this.name)
			},
			takeStep: function () {
				this.step++
			}
		}
	```
	* turns into
	```
		const actions = {
			sayName () {
				alert(this.name)
			},
			takeStep() {
				this.step++
			}
		}
	```


* what are [shorthand properties in ES6](https://learn.tylermcginnis.com/courses/51206/lectures/3167436)?
	* when an object variable property identifier and a parameter identifier are the same
		* you can remove the key
	* example
	```
		function getUser (username) {
			const email = getEmail(username)
			return {
				username: username,
				email: email
			}
		}
	```
	* turns into
	```
		function getUser (username) {
			const email = getEmail(username)
			return {
				username,
				email
			}
		}
	```

* what [are computed property names in javascript](https://learn.tylermcginnis.com/courses/51206/lectures/3167756)?
	* allows you to have an expression be computed as a property name on an object
		* this is pretty sick
	* example
	```
		function objectify (key, value) {
			let obj = {}
			obj[key] = value
			return obj
		}
	```
	* turns into
	```
		function objectify (key, value) {
			return {
				[key]: value
			}
		}
	```

* what are [template string in javascript](https://learn.tylermcginnis.com/courses/51206/lectures/816821)?
	* basically string interpolation
	* also supports multi-line strings
	* example
	```
		function makeGreeting (name, email, id) {
			return 'hello, ' + name + '. we have emailed you at ' + email + '.'
		}
	```
	* turns into
	```
		function makeGreeting (name, email, id) {
			return `hello, ${name}. We haveve emailed you at ${email}.`
		}
	```
	
* what are [arrow functions in javascript ES6](https://learn.tylermcginnis.com/courses/51206/lectures/816809)?
	* serve two main purposes
		* more concise syntax
		* sharing lexical this with the parent scope
	* if everything is on one line arrow function will implicitly return whatever is on that line
	* example
	```
		render () {
			return (
				<ul>
					{this.state.friends.map((friend) => <FriendItem key={friend.id} handleAddFriend={this.onAddFriend}>{friend.name}</FriendItem>)}
				</ul>
			)
		}
	```

* what are [default parameters in javascript](https://learn.tylermcginnis.com/courses/51206/lectures/816822)?
	* allows you to set default parameters so that if they are not set they will still have a value
	```
		function debounce(func, wait = 1000, immediate) {
			....
		}
	```

* what is the [spread operator in javascript](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-spread-operator-a867a71668ca)?
	* allows an  expression to be expanded in place where multiple elements/variables/arguments are exprected 
	* syntax
		* `...`
	* goes before the variable to be expanded
	* example
	```
		var middle = [3, 4];
		var arr = [1, 2, ...middle, 5, 6];
		console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	```

* what are [native javascript promises](https://www.promisejs.org/)?
	* the core idea behind promises is that a promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation
	* three different states
		* pending
			* initial state of a promise
		* fulfilled
			* the state of a promise representing a successful operation
		* rejected
			* the state of a promise representing a failed operation
	* once a promise is fulfilled or rejected it is immutable
	* .done
		* to use a promise we must be able to wait for it to be fulfilled or rejected	
		* used when nothing will be done with the result
		* example
		```
			function readJSON(filename) {
				return new Promise(function (fulfill, reject) {
					readFile(filename, 'utf8').done(function (res) {
						try {
							fulfill(JSON.parse(res));
						} catch (ex) {
							reject(ex);
						}
					}, reject;
				});
			}
		```
	* .then
		* used when something will be done with the result 
		```
			function readJSON(filename) {
				return readFile(filename, 'utf8').then(JSON.parse);
			}
		```

* what is [transpiling in javascript](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them)?
	* also known as source-to-source compilers
	* tools that read source code written in one programming language and produce the equivalent code in another language
	* compile-to-js languages
		* languages that compile to js
		* coffeescript and typescript are examples of this
	* to use ES2015 and ES6 reliably with wide browser support, must transpile
		* can compile down to ES5 or even ES3
	* babel is the bible 
		* most popular transpiler
	* `.babelrc`
		* a file at the top of your NPM project containing all of your preferences
	* source map
		* a file that tells the browser which lines of your transpiled code correspond to which lines of your original source
	* build tools
		* a set of tools used to manage the build process of a project
		* grunt and gulp are popular

* what is [polyfil in javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill)?
	* code that implements a feature on web browsers that do not support the feature
	* allow web developers to use an API regardless of whether it is supported by a browser or not and usually with minimal overhead

* what is a [shim in javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing))?
	* a small library that transparently intercepts API calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation elsewhere
	* used to support old API in newer environments or new API in older environments
