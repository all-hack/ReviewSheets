* how to think about strategic games (ch2)
  * decision versus games
    * strategic games
      * interactions between mutually aware players 
    * decisions
      * action situations where each person can choose without concern for reaction or response from others 
    * when each participant is significant in the interaction we must think of the interaction as a strategic game
  * classifying games
    * are the moves in the game sequential or simultaneous
      * the nature of the moves in a game has a deep impact on the strategy for playing the game
      * sequential
        * each player must think if i do this, how will my opponent react
        * current move governed by your calculation of its future consequences
      * simultaneous moves
        * each player must figure out what your opponent is going to do right now
        * the opponent is trying to figure out your move while you figure out his while he figures out you figuring out his
    * are the player' interest in total conflict, or is there some commonality
      * games are about satisfying interest and not all games are total conflict
      * constant-sum game, zero-sum game
        * players' interests are in complete conflict 
        * arise when players are dividing up any fixed amount of possible gain
      * most games have a tension between conflict and cooperation, and many of the most interesting analyses in game theory come from the need to handle it
    * is the game played once or repeatedly, and with the same or changing opponents
      * one-shot encounters
        * each player doesn't know much about the other players
          * poor information
        * secrecy and suprise is likely to be an important component of good strategy
      * ongoing relationships
        * opportunity to build a reputation and to gather information about your opponents
    * do the players have full or equal information
      * information of a game is rarely perfect
      * external uncertainty
        * when players are unaware or uncertain about information independent of their opponent and their strategy
        * not knowing the weather on the day of a football game is an external uncertainty
      * strategic uncertainty
        * when players are uncertain or unaware about information directly relevent to the opponent or their strategy
        * not knowing the play that the opponent is currently running in a football game is a strategic uncertainty 
      * perfect information
        * a game that has neither external nor strategic uncertainty 
        * chess is an example of this
      * imperfect information
        * a game has either external or strategic uncertainty or a mixture of the two
        * football is an example of this
      * incomplete information
        * players do not have complete information on one another
      * asymmetric information
        * one player has severily more information than the other
      * signals
        * when the more informed player provides objective evidence or actions that are credible proof of your information
      * signaling
        * strategies that involve the use of signals
      * screening devices
        * situations created by the less-informed player to make the more-informed player have to take some action that credibly reveals his information
      * screening
        * strategies that involve the use of screening devices
    * are the rules of the game fixed or manipulable
      * some games have rules that cannot be changed during the course of the game
      * some games have rules that are flexible before the game starts but then are fixed
      * some games have rules that go between phases of flexibility and rigidity 
      * those games in which the rules are flexible, the strategy then revolves around making the rules favor us
    * are agreements to cooperate enforceable
      * cooperative games
        * a misnomer meaning that within these games joint-action agreements are enforceable
      * noncooperative
        * games in which enforcement of joint-action agreements is not possible and individual participants must be allowed to act in their own interest
  * some terminology and background assumptions
    * strategies
      * the complete plan of actions available to the players
    * payoffs
      * imagine a numerical scale in which to compare all logically conveivable outcomes of the game, corresponding to each available combination of choices of strategies by all the players 
        * the number for a possible outcome on this scale is called that player's payoff for that outcome
        * these payoffs encompass all positive and negative outcome for a player based on that player's value set
    * expected payoff
      * if a player faces random prospect of outcomes then the number associated with this prospect is the average of the payoffs associated with each component outcome each weighed by its probability
        * with an outcome A that has payoff of 0 and a 75% probability of happening
        * and an outcome B that has a payoff of 100 and a 25% probability of happening
        * then the expected payoff is 25
    * rational behavior
      * an assumption in much of game theory that players are perfect calculators and flawless followers of their best strategies
      * basically means that players understand their own stratefy and can execute it flawlessly
      * often incorrect in actual use because most people have no fucking idea what they want
    * common knowledge of rules
      * we assume that at some level the players have a common understanding of the rules of the game
      * basic rules of game
        * the list of players
        * the strategies available to each player
        * the payoffs of each player for all possible combinations of strategies pursued by all the players
        * the assumption that each player is a rational maximizer
    * equilibrium
      * each player is using the strategy that is the best response to the strategies of the other players
  * the use of game theory
    * explanation
      * understand what's going on
    * prediction
      * predict what are likely or unlikely actions to happen and the results of them
    * advice
      * we can give advice to other game players on how to best move forward
